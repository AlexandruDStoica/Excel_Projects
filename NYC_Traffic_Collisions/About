Identify Seasonal Patterns
In the first objective, the focus was on understanding seasonal patterns in collision data. 
The analysis involved calculating the number of collisions by month and year. 
A line chart was used to visually represent the data, with each year displayed as a separate line. 
To enhance accuracy, incomplete data for April 2023 was filtered out. 
The finalized chart not only provides a clear overview of collision trends over the years but also facilitates the identification of any recurring patterns.

Visualize Weekly Trends
The second objective aimed to uncover weekly trends in collision occurrences. 
Weekday and hour information was extracted from the 'Date' and 'Time' columns, allowing for a detailed analysis of collisions by time of day and day of the week. 
A heatmap was utilized to visualize collision hotspots, with a "white-white-red" 3-color scale emphasizing the most dangerous periods. 
This visualization provides valuable insights into when accidents are more likely to happen during the week.

Analyze Contributing Factors
The final objective delved into identifying the top 10 contributing factors to collisions. 
By calculating the count of 'Collision ID' by each contributing factor and filtering the top 10, the analysis highlighted the major causes. 
Additionally, the percentage of collisions involving injuries or fatalities was computed for each contributing factor. 
The results were visually represented using data bars, offering a clear understanding of the severity associated with each contributing factor. 
This analysis provides actionable insights for addressing specific factors contributing to dangerous collisions.

Conclusion:

This comprehensive traffic safety analysis project successfully achieved its objectives by exploring seasonal patterns, visualizing weekly trends, 
and analyzing contributing factors to collisions. 
The visualizations and insights obtained from this analysis can inform targeted interventions and policies to enhance road safety.
