This is a guided project by Maven Analytics.

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze traffic collisions, identifying seasonal patterns, weekly trends, and contributing factors. 
The analysis is divided into three stages: identifying seasonal patterns, visualizing weekly trends, and analyzing contributing factors.

Identify Seasonal Patterns
 Calculated the count of 'Collision ID' by year and month.
 Visualized the data using a line chart. 
 Filtered out the incomplete month of April 2023.
 Modified the line chart to display each year as a separate line.
 Applied formatting to finalize the chart. 
 Summarized insights from the analysis.

Visualize Weekly Trends
 Extracted the Weekday and Hour from the 'Date' and 'Time' columns.
 Calculated the count of 'Collision ID' by Weekday and Hour.
 Created a heatmap to visualize collision hotspots by time of day and day of the week. 
 Modified the heatmap to a "white-white-red" 3-color scale.
 Summarized insights from the analysis.

Analyze Contributing Factors
 Calculated the count of 'Collision ID' by 'Contributing Factor.'
 Filtered and sorted the top 10 contributing factors by collisions in descending order.
 Calculated '% of Dangerous Collisions' for each contributing factor.
 Visualized the results using data bars.
 Summarized insights from the analysis, focusing on contributing factors and the percentage of collisions involving injuries or fatalities.

Conclusion:
This traffic collision analysis report provides a comprehensive overview of seasonal patterns, weekly trends, and contributing factors. 
The visualizations and findings aim to support data-driven decision-making for enhancing road safety and accident prevention.
