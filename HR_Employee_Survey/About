Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the results of an Employee Satisfaction Survey. 
The analysis is divided into three stages: profiling and QA of the data, preparation of clean source data for visualization, and the visualization of insights and findings.

Profile & QA the Data 
 Calculated key metrics (minimum, maximum, count, blanks) for each numerical field.
 Removed records with blank responses.
 Eliminated records containing duplicate values across all fields.
 Determined the count or frequency of each value in the Department and Question fields.
 Standardized inconsistencies in the Department and Question fields.

Prepare the Data for Visualization.
 Established a new tab named Chart Source.
 Generated a unique list of survey questions.
 Calculated the count of records for each response type (1-4) and the average response for each question, excluding zeros.
 Added new columns to convert counts into percentages based on total responses for each question.
 Copied and pasted data as values.
 Sorted questions in descending order by average response.

Visualize the Data and Summarize Findings
 Visualized percentages as a 100% stacked bar chart.
 Positioned the question with the highest average response at the top.
 Updated colors to signify positive and negative responses.
 Added data labels and optimized chart elements for improved readability.

Conclusion:
This Employee Satisfaction Survey Analysis aims to provide a clear understanding of employee sentiments. 
The visualizations and findings are intended to guide the HR leadership team in making informed decisions to enhance overall employee satisfaction.
