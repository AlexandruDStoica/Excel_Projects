Calculating Basic Profile Metrics:
Minimum, maximum, count, and number of blanks have been calculated for each numerical field.

Data Cleaning and Standardization
Records with blank responses have been removed.
Duplicate records across all fields have been eliminated.
The Department and Question fields have been profiled for frequency, and inconsistencies have been standardized.

Prepare the Data for Visualization
A new tab named "Chart Source" has been created, containing a unique list of survey questions
For each question, the count of records associated with each response type (1-4) and the average response, excluding zeros, have been calculated.
Additional columns have been added to convert counts into percentages based on the total responses for each questions.
The data has been copied and pasted as values, and questions have been sorted descending by average response.

Visualize the Data and Summarize Findings
Percentages have been visualized using a 100% stacked bar chart, with the question having the highest average response at the top.
Data labels have been added, the x-axis, title, and vertical gridlines removed, and individual chart elements formatted for better readability.

Insights and Recommendations
Insights and recommendations based on the visualized data will be presented to the HR leadership team.
