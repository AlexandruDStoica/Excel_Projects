This is a guided project by Maven Analytics.

Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze consumer complaints, identifying trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in customer service. 
The project is divided into three stages: calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), visualizing the weekly trend, and finalizing the report with formatting and polish.

 Calculation of KPIs
 Created a new column to identify the complaint status as "Open" or "Closed" based on the company's response.
 Added a column indicating the start of each week for complaints, setting Monday as the starting day.
 Extracted the Year, Month, and Day from the week start column.
 Adjusted the formula for the month to return the abbreviated month name ("Jan," "Feb," etc.).

 Visualization of the Weekly
 Inserted a new PivotTable to calculate the count of complaint IDs by status, including the total.
 Displayed the results in a single row with the heading "Complaints:" to the left.
 Added a prominent title ("Consumer Complaints Tracking") and applied formatting to enhance visual appeal.
 Inserted a timeline using the week start field to filter the results.
 
Finalization of the Report
 Calculated the count of complaint IDs by status and date. Created a stacked column chart to visualize the weekly trend.
 Connected the chart to the week start timeline for dynamic filtering.
 Positioned the "Open" column at the baseline for improved readability.
 Utilized colors from the "Open" and "Closed" KPIs as a legend for the chart. Applied additional formatting and alignment for a polished appearance.
 
Conclusion:
This report offers a comprehensive overview of consumer complaints, empowering the company to make strategic decisions for improved customer service and satisfaction.
