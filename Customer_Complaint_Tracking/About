This is a guided project by Maven Analytics

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze consumer complaints to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in customer service. 
It will be divided into three stages: calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), visualizing the weekly trend, and finalizing the report with formatting and polish.

Calculation of KPIs**
A new column will be created to identify whether a complaint is "Open" or "Closed" based on the company's response status to the consumer. 
("In progress" is considered "Open," while other statuses are considered "Closed").
A column indicating the start of the corresponding week for each complaint will be added, setting Monday as the starting day.
The year, month, and day will be extracted from the week start column.
The formula for the month will be adjusted to return the month name in abbreviated format ("Jan," "Feb," etc.).

Visualization of the Weekly Trend**
The count of complaint IDs by status, including the overall total, will be calculated.
The results will be displayed in a single row with the heading "Complaints:" to the left.
A prominent title ("Consumer Complaints Tracking") will be added, and formatting will be applied to both the title and KPIs.
A timeline using the week start field will be inserted to filter the results.

Finalization of the Report
The count of complaint IDs by status (columns) and year, month, and day (rows) will be calculated. A stacked column chart will be created to visualize the weekly trend.
The chart will be connected to the week start timeline filter.
The "Open" column will be placed at the baseline of the chart for improved readability.
The colors in the "Open" and "Closed" KPIs will be used as a legend for the chart, and additional formatting and alignment will be applied to finalize the report.

Conclusion:
This report will provide a detailed insight into the management of consumer complaints, enabling the company to make informed decisions to enhance customer service 
and satisfaction.
